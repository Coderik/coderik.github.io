  During my PhD I was working on the problem of affine invariant point-wise image comparison. Let's say we have two images and we want to know, how similar or different two given points in these images are. In other words we want to assign a similarity value (a single number) to a given pair of points. The similarity values computed at various locations over the images can tell us, for example, that two images depict the same object. This is quite useful for various applications. And it is getting more interesting, when we assume that the object can be captured from different viewpoints. We still want to obtain exactly the same similarity values for corresponding points, even when the object gets relatively transformed in one of the images. Study of such comparison, invariant to affine transformations, was the core part of my work. It formed the basis for novel image inpainting and image denoising methods, and eventually might prove useful in many other applications.
